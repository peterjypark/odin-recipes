        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbps flour</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tsp lemon zest</li>
            <li>2 oz crema cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup, 1 tbsp, 1 tsp cheese</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Brush butter on the bottom and up the sides of two 5 1/2-ounce ramekins. Scoop in some sugar; rotate ramekins to coat while pouring most of the sugar back into its container. Place ramekins on a shallow baking pan.</li>
            <li>Separate eggs between 2 bowls. Add sugar, flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, vanilla extract, lemon zest, cream cheese, and Cheddar cheese to the yolks. Mix the souffle base with a spatula until sugar and flour disappear.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a pinch of salt over the room-temperature egg whites. Beat with a whisk until soft peaks form; peaks should hold their shape but not be stiff or dry. Stir and fold 1/2 of the egg whites into the souffle base until combined. Gently fold the rest of the egg whites into the batter.</li>
            <li>Fill ramekins up to the lip with the batter.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until puffed and browned, about 12 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
